# eLotus Challenges

At **eLotus**, we'd like to give you the freedom to choose the types of problems
you want to solve, and the time for you to do them well.

The purpose of this repository is to challenge you to show us some of your
skills in programming, web development, visualisation, analysis, infrastructure
design, security, and everything in between.

When you're done, send us back a link to a repository with your source code,
with a description of what you've done and any build instructions in the readme!

Most importantly, make sure you have fun doing the challenge! And of course, if
you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us!

Cheers ðŸŽ‰
